# WTFJK PLANS

## FIXME

- roshinvasion starting when enemies are dead breaks the dead animation (t-pose)
- drunk mode breaks skipping cinematics (timescale != 1.0?)
- inclement weather doesn't reset the constantwind direction (shielding animation always plays 😮‍💨)
- inclement weather (and probably others) doesn't reset on quickload (though another mutator is active)
- when giants mode ends, enemies are halfway stuck in the floor
- giants bboxes and saber/projectile collision is not scaled 😭

## TODO

- think of more mutators
- port rd-badcandy for visual effects (glsl)
  - noir
  - acid trip
- obtain/create assets for mutators (tinnitus, models, NPCs)

## MUTATOR IDEAS

- paranoia: bunch of ghost enemies spawn and float around
  - only render force sight shell?
- enemy blasters shoot out mouse droids that inject drugs into you
- spider popup, crawls across the screen. but only rarely
- random black hair strand appears on the screen
- second person mode: camera is from enemy eyes, with NPCs eyes locked on player and constantly approaching
- become a tiny, upside down sand_creature that's very bouncy; you have to eat the enemies from above by landing on them
- a meta mutator that transforms the game into autismjk?
  - dickbutts randomly spawn in the map, become deformed and vanish
  - CoD hit markers
- mine monster snarks
